# Homepage-react

This is a custom Homepage build on React. It shows what I want to see, exactly how I want to see it!

Most existing Homepage Applications require the user to set it up via the UI and don't support a declarative deployment. Those that do (e.g. Gatus) have a very simple Configuration Format and Layout. Therefor I built my own.

Because everything is hardcoded, this application is useless for anyone else. Good Bye!
